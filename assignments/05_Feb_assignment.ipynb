    "## Class: \n",
    "Class is a detailed description, the definition, and the template of what an object will be. But it is not the object itself. Also, what we call, a class is the building block that leads to Object-Oriented Programming. It is a user-defined data type, that holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It is the blueprint of any object. Once we have written a class and defined it, we can use it to create as many objects based on that class as we want.\n",

    "Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: __init__  is  a Constructor in Python. Constructors are used to initializing the object’s state. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your obje"

    "Why self is used in OOPs? <br>\n",
    "Ans:Self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on."
